## Getting Started 
To get started, here is the link to [Android SDK integration documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Android-SDK-3/wiki).

## Upgrade 
#### SDK 2.x:

Please note that updating from our 2.x SDK is not a drag and drop update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order to take advantage of the 3.x SDK, a complete re-integration is necessary. Please review our [documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Android-SDK-3/wiki) to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.

#### SDK 3.x:
Updating from our previous SDK 3.x to SDK 3.2.0 is a simple drag and drop update or via gradle for interstitial and rewarded interstitial integrations. Partners using Instant-Feed should note the change to our callbacks [here.](https://adcolony-www-common.s3.amazonaws.com/Javadoc/3.2.0/index.html)

**Manual**

* Drag and drop the adcolony.jar into your project.
* Drag and drop the native libraries your application supports into your project.

**Via Gradle**

Assuming our maven repo is added to your project (see our [project setup guide](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-Android-SDK-3/wiki/Project-Setup)), update your 'dependencies' configuration within your module's build.gradle to point to the latest version:

```
dependencies {
  /** 
   * Any other dependencies your module has are placed in this dependency configuration
   */
  compile 'com.adcolony:sdk:3.2.0'
}
```
